SOURCE_ATTR="tcp,instance_per_station"
SOURCE_MSG="The Antelope ORB plugin is not distributed with the SeisComP
distribution because it requires the Antelope dynamic run-time
libraries.  For this reason you must download the source code
and compile it with your local Antelope installation.
The most current orb_plugin source code can be found at:
http://www.iris.edu/pub/programs/SeedLink/

After compiling the plugin you must copy the binary (orb_plugin)
to the SeisComP bin directory (e.g. $PKGROOT/bin)"
