<!-- timetable_loader is an external script that is supposed to give
     starting SEED record number and time for all streams. If
     overlap_removal is set to "initial" or "full", then earlier records
     will be discarded (record number is used in case several subsequent
     records have the same header time).
     
     Command FIFO has beed replaced by more powerful extension interface.
