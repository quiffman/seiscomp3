2006.11.6: version 2006.310
	- Check return value of send_raw_depoch() and exit(1) if data
	was not sent to seedlink.
	
2003.2.27: version 2003.057
	- Use the send_raw_depoch() plugin funcion.  This interface
	was introduced in SeisComP-1.1.93.2003.048 with SeedLink
	version 2.93; it will not work in older code bases.
	- Remove all remaining dependence on qlib2, mostly done
	by stealing the swa8() function from qutils.c
	
2002.11.8: version 2002.312
	- Changed time conversion again.  Now I believe that no leap
	seconds should be applied.  Plus the previous changed resulted
	in a loss of time resolution (milliseconds).
	
2002.10.29: version 2002.302
	- Changed time conversion routine to the correct one that will
	apply leap seconds (routine from qlib2).  Aaarrrggg, any data
	before this change was 21 seconds in the future.
	
2002.4.11
	- Changed log message printing to match the SeedLink log file
	format.

2002.3.22: version 2002.081
	- First version.  Works pretty well and is pretty feature rich
	for an initial version.
