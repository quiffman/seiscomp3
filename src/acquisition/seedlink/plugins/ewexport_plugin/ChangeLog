2009.040:
	- Update my_getaddrinfo() to fall back to the system getaddrinfo()
	so compiling is not limited to Solaris and Linux.
	- Add packet start time when printing details of TRACEBUF packets.
	- Increase maximum log message length from 100 to 200 bytes.
	- Convert usage of longs to ints so 64-bit build works, the program
	does not particularly benefit from being a 64-bit executable.
	- Many small typos.

2004.016: Apparently no change log until this point.
