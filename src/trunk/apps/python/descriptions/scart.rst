The archive tool scart creates playback files (multiplexed MiniSEED files) from
SDS structured data (e.g. created by slarchive) or from data passed from
another record source such as :ref:`Arclink <arclink>`. It can also playback
records directly out of an SDS structure. Furthermore it can be used to import
multiplexed MiniSEED files into a local SDS structure.
So it is possible to save event based waveform data in combination with
scevtstreams into another archive.
