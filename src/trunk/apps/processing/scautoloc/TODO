Next steps:

* Improve nucleation threshold. While the nucleator ignores stations
  beyond a configurable distance, the associator does not, which is
  bad.

  We need a way to express something like

    "Use this station for event nucleation only up to 20 degrees."

  This is already achieved by setting the "max. nucleation distance"
  parameter in station.conf (4th column). However, if it's a big
  teleseismic event we want this station to contribute phases and
  magnitudes as well. Therefore we need a score-dependent maximum
  association distance. This means that at a given distance, a
  station may contribute a phase to an event if the score is large
  enough. Here the score seems to be a better criterion than number
  of stations.

  But it also has a disadvantage. If some stations are down, which
  would otherwise increase the score, the score threshold may not
  be  reached for that distance and the station not be used. For
  the same reason there may be an increased regional dependence of
  the detectability of an event.

  A magnitude based criterion would be best, but initially we don't
  have magnitudes.

* Improve score calculation. Somehow we need to include PKP,
  perhaps by setting a configurable weight. Omitting PKP in score
  computation results in wrong origins where PKP is incorectly
  considered P and increases the score.

  This would require a different treatment of arrivals based on
  their "excluded" flag: Phases excluded only based on phase type
  would be counted in the score, though with relatively low (but
  configurable) weight.

  In the logging such phases would be marked as excluded from origin
  computation with a lower-case "x", whereas normally excluded
  phases are marked with an upper-case "X".

* Process manual origins passively, i.e. only associate picks
  without relocating
