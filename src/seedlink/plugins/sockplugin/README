sock_plugin:

A SeedLink plugin that will connect to a TCP socket, collect 512-byte
Mini-SEED records, and pass them on to the SeedLink daemon.

The plugin will search the record for a 1000 blockette and use it to
verify a 512-byte record length.  The packet will be dropped if no 1000
blockette is found or if the record size is not 512 bytes.

The network code in the Mini-SEED records can be changed using the
'-n' command line option.  The change is done after matching (if the
'-m' option is used).

To compile for the Solaris environment the LDLIBS variable in the Makefile
must include '-lsocket' and '-lnsl'.  These are not necessary and should
be commented out for a Linux environment.

For testing it is recommended that you use the verbose flag twice "-vv",
then sock_plugin will report on each packet that is received from the
remote host.
