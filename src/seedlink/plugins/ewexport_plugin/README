ewexport_plugin:

This is a SeedLink plugin that collects data from an Earthworm
export_? process.  Usually the export_scnl program is run on a host
with access to the appropriate data; export_scnl is a version of
export_generic that will only transfer waveform data.  While
ewexport_plugin will accept any Earthworm messages only waveform data
will be processed.
