This is libgcf2 a library which is
meant to make dealing with GCF datafiles, devices which talk
GCF, disks with GCF on them and GCF network services much
much easier.

In particular libgcf2 lets you do the following.

* Receive GCF from scream via TCP or UDP, with optional
  automatic recovery of lost blocks.

* Read Parse and Extract Data from GCF stored either in
  directories, files or DISKS.

* libgcf2 will directly access SCSI and IEEE1493 (firewire)
  disks without the requirement to write labels first.

* quickly (3-4 seconds) find the data you want in large
  (10Gb) files.

* Interpret disks written by SAMs and 6TDs.

* run on Solaris and Linux (Win32 support planned)

* talk directly to instruments connected to serial ports

* allows sending of commands via TCP to scream or directly
  to a connected instrument

* deal with whatever hoops are required to be jumped for
  your system to get files > 4Gb to work.

libgcf2 is designed to use the same small amount of memory
regardless of the size of the files you want it to deal with.
This feature makes libgcf2 especially suitable for embedding
into low power and lightweight systems.

see the examples directory for some documented examples.

libgcf2 installs a libgcf2-config script so that you can find it later.
