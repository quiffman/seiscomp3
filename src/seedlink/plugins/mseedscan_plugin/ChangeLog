2006.292:
	- Change -m option to -M and add -R to have both match and
	reject regexs for filenames.
	- Add the -Q option to skipping the scanning of files that
	have not been modified for a specified number of seconds,
	by default this option is off.

2006.287:
	- Add -z option to do the nextnew scan-ahead stuff only
	when a statefile was specified but is not successfully read.
	- Use stat instead of lstat when checking if scan target
	directories exist and are in fact directories, should allow
	symbolic links to be specified.
	- Fix minor casting error in unused StackNotEmpty in stack.c.

2006.006:
	- Change long's to int's, needed for 64-bit architectures.
	The LP64 data model changed long & pointers to 64-bit while
	int, short and char did not change from the ILP32 model.
	- Change lprintf buffer size to 1024 characters.

2005.163:
	- Add '-D' option to take a file with a list of dirs
	that will be scanned.  The file will be re-checked every
	10 scans and if it has been modified the list will be
	re-loaded.
	- Add make target 'testing' to build without libslplugin.

2005.144:
	- Re-work scanfiles again to properly fix scanning with
	either absolute or relative paths.  The function now 
	differentiates between the local target directory (since
	chdir is done each time) and the complete path from the
	initial directory.
	- Move regex checking to after directory detection so
	as not to skip directories that do not match.
	- Add offset into error message about invalid Mini-SEED.

2005.143:
	- Move the filename from the binary tree node data to the
	node key and remove the device number.  The tree now keys
	off of the inode number and then filename.  It remains a
	fast search as the string comparison (filename) is only
	done after the number comparison (inode) matches.
	- Change option '-i' to '-s'.
	- Add options '-i' and '-I' to control the scanning of
	idle directory entries.  This allows idle files to not
	be checked every scan and further optimizes the scanning.
	- Change maximum directory entry name length to 512.

2005.139:
	- Fix usage of non-absolute paths as target directories,
	includes the assumption that the directory separation
	character is '/'.

2005.101:
	- Add option to create a "station_id" (passed to the server)
	of "NET_STA" instead of the default of "STA".  This is
	necessary with duplicate station codes from different
	networks.

2004.231:
	- Implement a balanced tree to keep track of the file list,
	this resulted in a huge improvement in scalability.
	- Change scanfiles() to chdir into the working directory 
	allowing lstat to be called without absolute paths, it's
	faster.
	- Lots of little fixups.

2004.226:
	- More optimizations.
	- Lots of little fixups.

2004.225:
	- Fix prunefiles() so it works when adjacent chain entries
	are being pruned.
	- Only fallback to searching the filelist with strcmp
	when one or more inodes matched.
	- Fix some potential non-terminated strings when doing
	strncpy.

2004.217:
	- Change name to mseedscan_plugin for clarity.
	- Base directories now specified with the -d option.
	- Remove trailing slash from input directories.
	- Check that the input directories exist during startup
	and log a warning if not.  If the entry does not exist
	it will be checked during each scan, this way if it
	appears it will be scanned as expected.

2004.216: initial version
