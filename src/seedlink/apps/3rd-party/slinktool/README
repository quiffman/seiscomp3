slinktool, the all-in-one SeedLink client.

For usage information see the slinktool(1) man page in the 'doc'
directory.

-- Building and Installation --

Requirements:

1) ANSI C compiler

2) libxml2 version 2.4.23 or greater (www.xmlsoft.org)


In most environments a simple 'make' will compile the program.
 
Using GCC under Linux or Solaris, running 'make static' will compile a
static version if the appropriate libraries are present.
 
GCC can be explicitly used by running 'make gcc'.

SunOS/Solaris:
 
In order to compile under Solaris the 'src/Makefile' needs to be edited.
See the Makefile for instructions.
 
 
For further installation simply copy the resulting binary and man page
(in the 'doc' directory) to appropriate system directories.


LibXML2:

This package requires libxml2 version 2.4.23 or greater
(www.xmlsoft.org).  If the compile process fails with messages about
not being able to find <libxml/xmlerror.h> or <libxml/parser.h> and it
is certain that libxml2 is installed on the system the 'src/Makefile'
will have to be edited to include the proper directory on the CFLAGS
line where the libxml2 headers can be found.
