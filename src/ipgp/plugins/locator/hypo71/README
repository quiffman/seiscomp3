# HYPO71 is a computer program for determining hypocenter,         #
# magnitude, and first motion pattern of local earthquakes, and    #
# was first released in 1971. It is perhaps the first earthquake   #
# location program that achieved worldwide usage, as evidenced by  #
# the fact that about 1,000 copies of the HYPO71 manual were       #
# requested and distributed (Lee, 1990). It is included here for   #
# historical documentation.                                        #
